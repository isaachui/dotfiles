## General setup

run `/.setup.sh` and it should setup everything. The vimrc plugins install might not work out totally fine, but no time to debug right now.

## Iterm2 Setup
After installing iTerm2, manually add the profile and preferences from the settings.
For preferences:
```
-> "General"
-> "Preferences"
-> "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL"
-> "Browse"
-> /path/to/isaachui/dotfiles/iterm2
```

For profiles:
```
-> "Profiles"
-> "Other Actions"
-> "import json profiles"
-> Select /path/to/isaachui/dotfiles/itermProfile.json
```
